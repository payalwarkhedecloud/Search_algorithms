# Search Algorithms in C++
This repository contains simple C++ implementations of:

1) Linear Search (`linear_search.cpp`)
 2)Binary Search (`binary_search.cpp`)
Perfect for beginners learning searching techniques.
This program implements finding a key by linear  search and binary search.

>>Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that checks each element one by one until the target element is found or the list ends.
It works well for unsorted array.

>>Binary Search is an efficient algorithm that works only on sorted arrays.
It repeatedly divides the search space in half and checks if the middle element is the target.
